# Emarsys Home Assignment

## Summary

I choosed to do the assignment in node.js, because lately _js_ became one of my favourite languages.

The main method CalculateDueDate is in the index.js file. Every minor function the main method uses can be found in the helpers.js file. Before using the program the dependencies must be installed from the package.json file, with the following command:
```
npm install
```

For testing I used the "tape" lib. The tests are positioned in the test folder, and can be run with the following command:
```
npm run test
```

The CalculateDueDate function can be used after imported as a module.
